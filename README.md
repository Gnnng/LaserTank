Laser Tank
=========

This is a tank game called "laser tank" running on Windows which is authored by [Gnnng](https://github.com/Gnnng) and [denil111](https://github.com/denil1111)

Introduction
======
In fact, this is a final programming project for our lesson which is "Advanced C Programming" in our 1st year of university.

It has been almost one year since we finished the lesson and closed the project. Though this project brought a good grade to us, it still needs to be improved and perfected. 

Platform
======
This game is developed on MSVC 2012. Of course you can get the code and compile it by any MSVC version.


To Be Done
========
The docs is insufficient and imperfect. So we still need some time to update it. If you need any help of this project, you can make a contact to us via email.
